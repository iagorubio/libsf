    TODO LIST

    * combine both databases into a single MySQL database.

    * add xprobe-style ICMP scans

    - timeouts on the port scans.

    - add the debug and verbose messaging

    - Finish passive ID section (the infrastructure is all there.. it's just
      a little legwork) .

    - Add -p (profiling) option to db_import.  This option would profile a
      specified IP address and add it to the database after querying the user
      for its type.

    - Add support for other sig db types

    - Add some nice easy/intuitive functions for displaying/modifying the 
      database sigs via db_import.  Possibly a scripting/interpretive language
      for easily creating sigs.

    - Database layout optimization

    - Portability testing

    - Investigate a possible caching system for unknown/new sigs

    - Signature authenticity and verification system that would evaluate
      the signature database to gain a higher trustworthyness and base score
      (advanced scoring) based upon amount of times this sig has been 
      encountered in the wild with perfect (verfiable) accuracy.

    - Peer review and code optimization
